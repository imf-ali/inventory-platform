## Analysis & Reasoning
The PR introduced state variables for a threshold configuration feature that was never fully implemented. The variables showConfig, defaultThreshold, and setDefaultThreshold were declared at lines 20-21 but never read anywhere in the component code.

While setShowConfig was called in the Configure Thresholds button's onClick handler, the showConfig state itself was never consumed to conditionally render a configuration modal or any other UI element. Similarly, defaultThreshold and setDefaultThreshold were completely unused.

TypeScript's unused variable check (TS6133) correctly flagged these as errors. The fix removes these incomplete feature artifacts while preserving the UI button with a TODO comment, allowing the threshold configuration feature to be properly implemented in the future without breaking the current build.

This approach respects the PR's intent to add inventory low alert functionality with pagination and detail views, which are working correctly, while cleanly removing the incomplete threshold configuration scaffolding.
